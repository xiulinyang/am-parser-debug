This directory contains the files that do AM algebra stuff. 

They were written before two deadlines and weren't cleaned up, this might be necessary though.
Due to this being an incomplete reimplementation, it contains duplicated code for AMConllSentences.

The code here is responsible for everything INCLUDING AND AFTER fixed-tree decoding. In particular, the ConllSent class
is used in the fixed-tree decoder and for writing to file.
